This is a GUI editor which can create and edit pinball tables for the Vector Pinball Android app (https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball). It runs anywhere that supports Java 8. It is released under version 3 of the GPL; see "COPYING" for the license text.

It is in an approximately alpha state; it basically works but there are almost certainly bugs and the interface has rough edges, for example it won't warn you about unsaved changes.

Using this editor you can create new tables from scratch, or use the existing Vector Pinball tables as a starting point. You can test tables as you're designing them, using the same physics engine as the Android app (Box2D, provided by libgdx). You can also customize the table logic with Groovy scripts.

Currently exporting tables to the Vector Pinball app is a manual process. Vector Pinball currently only supports built-in tables, so you would need to download the Vector Pinball source and copy your table to its assets/tables directory. I plan to add support for dynamically installing new tables in the future. In the meantime, feel free to send me (brian@vectorpinball.com) any fun tables that you create, for possible inclusion in new Vector Pinball releases.
